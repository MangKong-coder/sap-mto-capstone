## üîÑ Re-seeding

To reseed the database (careful - this deletes existing data):

```bash
uv run python scripts/seed_data.py --clear
```

To add additional data without clearing:

```bash
uv run python scripts/seed_data.py
```

To verify seeded data:

```bash
uv run python scripts/verify_seed.py
```
