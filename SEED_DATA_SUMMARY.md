# 🌱 Database Seed Script - Summary

## What Was Created

I've created a comprehensive seed script system to populate your database with reference data for entities that don't have frontend CRUD interfaces.

### 📁 Files Created

1. **`mto-backend/scripts/seed_data.py`** - Main seeding script
2. **`mto-backend/scripts/verify_seed.py`** - Verification script
3. **`mto-backend/scripts/README.md`** - Detailed documentation
4. **`mto-backend/scripts/SEED_DATA_REFERENCE.md`** - Quick reference guide

## 📊 Seeded Data Summary

### Total Records: **52 entities**

| Entity | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Customers** | 10 | Various customer types (Departments, Campus, Students, Vendors) |
| **Products** | 10 | Finished goods (Machinery, Equipment, Electronics, Furniture) |
| **Work Centers** | 7 | Manufacturing locations (Fabrication, Assembly, Testing, etc.) |
| **Components** | 25 | Raw materials and parts (Materials, Electronics, Mechanical, etc.) |

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Realistic Data
- **Customers**: Represent actual university stakeholders (departments, campus facilities, student groups, vendors)
- **Products**: Range from $1,200 to $150,000 (workbenches to automated assembly lines)
- **Work Centers**: Cover complete manufacturing flow (fabrication → assembly → testing → finishing)
- **Components**: Complete catalog from raw materials to packaging ($5 to $125 per unit)

### ✅ Well-Organized Code
- Follows PEP 8 standards
- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Modular functions
- Error handling with rollback
- Transaction safety

### ✅ Safe Operation
- Optional `--clear` flag for data reset
- Confirmation prompt before clearing data
- Detailed logging
- Rollback on errors
- Idempotent (can run multiple times safely)

## 🚀 How to Use

### First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Create database tables
uv run python scripts/create_db.py

# 2. Seed reference data
uv run python scripts/seed_data.py

# 3. Verify seeded data
uv run python scripts/verify_seed.py
```

### Re-seeding (with data wipe)
```bash
uv run python scripts/seed_data.py --clear
```

**⚠️ Warning**: The `--clear` flag will delete ALL customers, products, work centers, and components. It will prompt for confirmation.

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

The seeded entities integrate into your MTO workflow:

```
1. Seed Database (one-time)
   ↓
2. Create Sales Order (Frontend)
   - Select Customer (from seed data)
   - Select Product (from seed data)
   - Select Work Center (from seed data)
   ↓
3. Generate Planned Order
   ↓
4. Convert to Work Order
   ↓
5. Assign Components (from seed data)
   ↓
6. Complete Production
   ↓
7. Create Delivery
   ↓
8. Generate Invoice
```

## ✨ Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Department Order
```
Customer: Engineering Department
Product: Laboratory Workstation (EQUIP-001) @ $8,500
Work Center: Assembly Line 2
Quantity: 5 units
Total: $42,500
```

### Scenario 2: Student Project
```
Customer: Robotics Club
Product: Robotics Platform (EQUIP-003) @ $15,000
Work Center: Electronics Workshop
Quantity: 2 units
Total: $30,000
```

### Scenario 3: Large Campus Investment
```
Customer: Main Campus Facilities
Product: Automated Assembly Line (MACH-002) @ $150,000
Work Center: Main Fabrication
Quantity: 1 unit
Total: $150,000
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

The seed script has been tested and verified:

```
✅ Successfully seeded 10 customers
✅ Successfully seeded 10 products
✅ Successfully seeded 7 work centers
✅ Successfully seeded 25 components
✅ Verification script confirms all data present
✅ Transactions commit correctly
```

---

## 🔧 Extending the Data

To add more entities:

1. Edit `mto-backend/scripts/seed_data.py`
2. Add entries to the relevant data list:
   - `customers_data` for customers
   - `products_data` for products
   - `work_centers_data` for work centers
   - `components_data` for components
3. Run the script again

Example:
```python
# Add a new product
{
    "sku": "EQUIP-004",
    "name": "New Equipment",
    "description": "Description here",
    "price": 10000.00
}
```

## 📝 Notes

- These entities are **read-only** in normal application flow
- They are referenced/selected when creating sales orders
- No frontend CRUD needed (that's why we seeded them)
- Safe to run multiple times (won't create duplicates unless using `--clear`)
- All entities include proper timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`)

---

## 🎓 For Your Capstone

This seed script provides:
- ✅ Realistic demo data for presentations
- ✅ Test data for development
- ✅ Reference entities for order creation
- ✅ Complete material catalog
- ✅ Production facility setup

You can now create sales orders in the frontend that reference these seeded entities, demonstrating a complete MTO (Make-to-Order) workflow!

## 🤝 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Seed script created and tested**
2. ⏭️ Test creating sales orders via frontend
3. ⏭️ Verify order flow (Sales → Planned → Work Order → Delivery → Invoice)
4. ⏭️ Add component usage tracking
5. ⏭️ Generate reports and dashboards

---

**Status**: ✅ **Complete and Tested**

The seed script is ready to use and has been successfully tested with your database!
