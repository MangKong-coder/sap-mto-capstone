# Capstone Project: Make-to-Order (MTO) Manufacturing Flow

## Overview
This project implements a **basic Make-to-Order (MTO) manufacturing flow**, inspired by real-world SAP Production Planning (PP) and Sales & Distribution (SD) processes. Instead of using SAP itself, we are building a **custom simplified system** to simulate the flow using modern web technologies.

## Objectives
- Simulate the full production lifecycle triggered by customer orders.
- Provide a working prototype that demonstrates order tracking, production planning, and delivery processes.
- Build a web application with a backend (FastAPI, PostgreSQL) and a frontend (Next.js).

## Key Features
- **Sales Order Creation**: Customers place sales orders for products.
- **Production Planning**: Sales orders trigger planned orders automatically.
- **Production Execution**: Planned orders are converted into production orders.
- **Order Confirmation**: Production progress and completion are tracked.
- **Delivery & Billing**: Finished goods are delivered and billed to the customer.
- **Process Flow Documentation**: End-to-end mapping of the flow.

## Deliverables
- Working backend API (FastAPI + PostgreSQL).
- Database schema implementing MTO entities.
- Frontend dashboard to interact with the flow.
- Documentation and process flow diagrams.
- (Optional) A Fiori-like dashboard for order tracking.
