# Service Layer Implementation Summary

## Overview

The service layer has been successfully implemented for the MTO (Make-to-Order) backend system. This layer sits between the repository layer (CRUD operations) and the API layer, providing business logic, validation, and workflow orchestration.

## Error Handling

Each service defines custom exceptions:

- **Base Error** - `{Entity}ServiceError`
- **Validation Error** - `{Entity}ValidationError`
- **Not Found Error** - `{Entity}NotFoundError`
- **State/Business Error** - e.g., `OrderCancellationError`, `WorkOrderStateError`, `ConversionError`

These exceptions can be caught at the API layer and converted to appropriate HTTP status codes.

---

## MTO Workflow Support

The services support the complete Make-to-Order flow:

1. **Order Placement**: `place_order()` creates order with items
2. **Planning**: `generate_planned_order()` creates production plan
3. **Production**: `convert_to_work_order()` → `start_work_order()` → `consume_components()` → `confirm_work_order()`
4. **Delivery**: `schedule_delivery()` → `update_delivery_status()`
5. **Billing**: `generate_invoice()` → `post_invoice()` → `mark_invoice_paid()`

---

## Integration Points

### With Repository Layer
- All services import and use repository CRUD functions
- Services add validation and business logic on top of repositories
- Transactions handled at repository level, rolled back on service errors

### With API Layer (Future)
- Services are ready to be consumed by FastAPI routes
- Error exceptions map to HTTP status codes
- All functions return domain objects (ORM models) or dictionaries

---

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Service Layer Pattern** - Business logic separated from data access
2. **Repository Pattern** - Data access abstracted through repositories
3. **Exception Handling** - Custom exceptions for different error types
4. **Validation Pattern** - Input validation before database operations
5. **Aggregation Pattern** - Reporting functions aggregate across entities

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create API endpoints** that consume these services
2. **Add Pydantic schemas** for request/response validation
3. **Implement authentication/authorization** for secure access
4. **Add unit tests** for each service function
5. **Consider adding**:
   - Stock/inventory tracking (add fields to Product/Component models)
   - Workflow orchestration service for automated MTO flow
   - Notification service for status changes
   - Audit logging for all operations
