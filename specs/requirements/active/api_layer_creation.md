# ðŸ“‘ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Feature:** API Layer for MTO (Make-to-Order) Capstone Backend
**Owner:** Backend Team
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Background & Context

The capstone system models a **Make-to-Order manufacturing flow** inspired by SAP modules (PP, SD, MM).
We already have:

* **Repository Layer:** CRUD access to database.
* **Service Layer:** Business logic (validations, flow orchestration).

The next step is to build an **API Layer** that exposes the system functionality for the frontend (Fiori-like dashboard). The API must be RESTful, modular, and align with immutability principles (no hard deletes).

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

* Provide a **RESTful API** that exposes all business logic from the service layer.
* Ensure the endpoints are **consistent, predictable, and secure-ready**.
* Enable the frontend to:

  * Create and manage orders, products, customers.
  * Track planned orders, work orders, deliveries, invoices.
  * View reporting summaries across the MTO flow.
* Maintain **immutability**: entities are never deleted, only updated/canceled/closed.

---

## 3. Scope

### In-Scope

* Implementation of all API endpoints (see Section 5).
* Use of FastAPI routers grouped by domain (`orders`, `customers`, `products`, etc.).
* Pagination on all list endpoints.
* Error handling aligned with service-layer exceptions.

### Out-of-Scope

* Authentication/authorization (to be stubbed if needed).
* Advanced filtering/search (beyond pagination).
* UI/dashboard integration (handled by frontend team).

---

## 4. Success Metrics

* **Functional completeness:** All service functions are accessible via API.
* **Consistency:** All endpoints follow RESTful conventions (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`).
* **Reliability:** Proper error codes returned (`404` for not found, `400` for validation, etc.).
* **Usability:** Frontend can perform end-to-end MTO flow (order â†’ production â†’ delivery â†’ invoice).

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] All endpoints implemented and routed through FastAPI.
* [ ] Each router grouped by domain (`/orders`, `/products`, etc.).
* [ ] JSON request/response schemas defined using Pydantic.
* [ ] Validation errors return `400 Bad Request`.
* [ ] Missing entities return `404 Not Found`.
* [ ] Business logic violations (e.g., canceling a closed order) return `409 Conflict`.
* [ ] Pagination query params standardized (`?page=1&size=20`).
* [ ] End-to-end test: place order â†’ planned order â†’ work order â†’ delivery â†’ invoice â†’ reporting.

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk:** Too many endpoints may overwhelm frontend.

  * *Mitigation:* Provide reporting APIs to reduce frontend aggregation.
* **Risk:** Without auth, APIs are open.

  * *Mitigation:* Add stubbed middleware for later RBAC if required.
* **Risk:** Time constraints may prevent bonus features (BOM, routing).

  * *Mitigation:* Keep scope to MTO core flow.
