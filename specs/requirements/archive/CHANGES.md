# Backend Refactoring Changes

**Date:** 2025-09-30

## Summary

Refactored the backend structure to simplify the database configuration and consolidate models into a single file.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Configuration (✓ Completed)

**Changed:** `app/core/config.py`
- Removed individual database connection parameters (`POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, etc.)
- Now reads `DATABASE_URL` directly from the `.env` file
- Simplified configuration from a computed property to a direct field

**Before:**
```python
POSTGRES_USER: str = "postgres"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: str = "postgres"
# ... other fields

@property
def DATABASE_URL(self) -> str:
    return f"postgresql://{self.POSTGRES_USER}:..."
```

**After:**
```python
DATABASE_URL: str  # Read directly from .env
```

### 2. Models Consolidation (✓ Completed)

**Changed:** Models structure
- Consolidated all models into a single file: `app/models.py`
- Removed the `models/base.py` file from the root directory
- Removed individual model files from `app/models/` directory
- Removed `app/db/base.py` file

**Removed Files:**
- `models/base.py` (root directory)
- `models/__init__.py` (root directory)
- `app/db/base.py`
- `app/models/delivery.py`
- `app/models/production_order.py`
- `app/models/sales_order.py`
- `app/models/user.py`

**New Structure:**
- All models (Customer, Product, Order, OrderItem, PlannedOrder, WorkOrder, Component, ComponentUsage, Delivery, Invoice) are now in `app/models.py`

### 3. Import Updates (✓ Completed)

Updated all imports throughout the codebase:

**Files Updated:**
- `app/crud/sales_orders.py`
- `app/crud/production_orders.py`
- `app/crud/deliveries.py`
- `app/crud/users.py`
- `app/schemas/sales_order.py`
- `app/schemas/production_order.py`
- `app/schemas/delivery.py`
- `app/schemas/user.py`
- `app/services/mto_flow.py`
- `app/services/reporting.py`
- `alembic/env.py`
- `scripts/create_db.py`

**Before:**
```python
from app.db.base import Base
from app.models.sales_order import SalesOrder, OrderStatus
```

**After:**
```python
from app.models import Base, SalesOrder, OrderStatus
```

### 4. Documentation Updates (✓ Completed)

**Updated:** `specs/requirements/active/setup.md`
- Removed instructions to create `app/db/base.py`
- Changed from creating multiple model files to a single `app/models.py`
- Removed `app/models/__init__.py` from the init files list
- Updated project tree diagram
- Added section on environment configuration with `.env` file

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Configuration**: Database URL is now managed in one place (`.env` file)
2. **Single Source of Truth**: All models in one file makes it easier to see relationships
3. **Reduced File Count**: Fewer files to navigate and maintain
4. **Consistent Imports**: All model imports follow the same pattern

## Environment Setup

Your `.env` file should now contain:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

## Verification

All changes have been tested and verified:
- ✓ Models import correctly
- ✓ DATABASE_URL loads from .env
- ✓ Database engine initializes properly
- ✓ All import references updated

## Next Steps

If you want to apply database migrations:
```bash
cd mto-backend
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
alembic upgrade head
```
